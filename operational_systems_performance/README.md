## Key Insights

- Wind power generation exhibits high natural variability, with an average daily output of approximately 41% of maximum capacity.
- Clear intra-day patterns are visible, with higher average power output during early morning and evening hours.
- Using a statistical threshold-based approach (mean ± 2 standard deviations), approximately 2.3% of days were flagged as operational anomalies.
- Identified anomalies correspond to unusually high generation periods rather than system underperformance, indicating favourable wind conditions rather than reliability issues.
- This approach demonstrates how simple, explainable rules can be used to support proactive monitoring and operational awareness in renewable energy systems.

## Operational Implications and Recommendations

- Threshold-based monitoring can be used to automatically flag days requiring further investigation or reporting.
- Identified high-output anomaly periods may inform grid planning, storage optimisation, or market dispatch strategies.
- Hourly performance profiles can support short-term operational forecasting and workforce planning.
- This analysis provides a foundation for more advanced monitoring techniques, such as rolling thresholds or predictive alerting.
